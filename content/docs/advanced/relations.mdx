title: Relations
---

Relations allow you to define how different schemas are connected to each other.
By establishing relationships, you can easily manage and query related data across different collections.
There are three main types of relations:

1. **one()**: This relation is used to define a one-to-one relationship between two schemas. 
   For example, in the User schema, a user can have one tutor, which is another user. 
   This is defined using the `one()` function, allowing you to easily navigate to the related user.

2. **many()**: This relation is used to define a one-to-many relationship. 
   In the Post schema, a user can be an author of many posts. 
   This is represented using the `many()` function, which allows you to retrieve all posts associated with a user.

3. **ref()**: This relation is used to create a reference to another schema. 
   In the User schema, the posts field references the Post schema, indicating that the posts are related to the user through the author field. 
   The `ref()` function helps in establishing this connection, enabling efficient data retrieval across schemas.

Understanding these relationships is crucial for structuring your data models effectively and ensuring smooth interactions between them.


### Using one()

```typescript
import { createSchema, string, objectId } from "monarch-orm";

const PostSchema = createSchema("posts", {
  title: string(),
  authorId: objectId(),
});

const UserSchema = createSchema("users", {
  name: string(),
})
.relations(({ one }) => ({
    posts: one(PostSchema, "authorId"),
  }));
```

### Using many()

```typescript
import { createSchema, string, objectId } from "monarch-orm";

const CommentSchema = createSchema("comments", {
  comment: string(),
  postId: objectId(),
});

const PostSchema = createSchema("posts", {
  title: string(),
  authorId: objectId(),
})
.relations(({ many }) => ({
    comments: many(CommentSchema, "postId"),
  }));
```

### Using ref()

```typescript
import { createSchema, string, objectId } from "monarch-orm";

const PostSchema = createSchema("posts", {
  title: string(),
  authorId: objectId(),
});

const UserSchema = createSchema("users", {
  name: string(),
  postId: objectId()
})
.relations(({ ref }) => ({
    posts: ref(PostSchema, "postId", "_id"),
  }));
```
